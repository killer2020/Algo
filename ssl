SSL Communication

Difference between keystore and trust store.

You are going to buy a fire extinguisher for you house,you are worried that someone can sell you
risky product and you say that I am going to buy only fire extinguisher which are approved by below organisation

(FDI corp,ABC corp and Govt of India)

Here you are "client" and the above three corporations are your "truststore", you trust them.



You go to shop he presents you a fire extinguisher verified by these organisations->(TMG corp,DEF corp).
You check if any of this is present in you "trust store".
No!!!! cant trust!!! you reject it.

Here shop is "Server" and (TMG corp,DEF corp) is there "keystore".

You go to another shop they give you fire extinguisher signed by (ABC corp and ZZZ corp).
You check this in your "truststore"----!!!!! Match (ABC corp) !!!  SSL communication established

And you buy that fire extinguisher as you know "ABC Corp" is renowned organisation and anything verified/signed by them is trustworthy.



This is very basic of how SSL communication is established.

Server has a "keystore" with certificates signed by some organisations.

Client has "truststore" with its own trusted certificates.

Client tries to connect to Server.

Server present its certificates and client check if certificates match its certificate in its trust store.

If yes match!!!! SSL communication is established.
